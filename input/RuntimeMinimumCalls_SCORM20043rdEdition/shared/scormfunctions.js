Want to make SCORM easy? See our solutions at http://www.scorm.com.

This example provides for the bare minimum SCORM run-time calls.
It will demonstrate using the API discovery algorithm to find the
SCORM API and then calling Initialize and Terminate when the page
loads and unloads respectively. This example also demonstrates
some basic SCORM error handling.

// in the window that is passed into the function.  If the object is
// found a reference to the object is returned to the calling function.
// If the instance is found the SCO now has a handle to the LMS
// provided API Instance.  The function searches a maximum number
// of parents of the current window.  If no object is found the
// function returns a null reference.  This function also reassigns a
// value to the win parameter passed in, based on the number of
// parents.  At the end of the function call, the win variable will be
// set to the upper most parent in the chain of parents.

// represents the current window.  The function is built to search in a

// The function begins by searching the current window’s parent, if the
// current window has a parent.  If the API Instance is not found, the
// function then checks to see if there are any opener windows.  If
// the window has an opener, the function begins to look for the
// API Instance in the opener window.
